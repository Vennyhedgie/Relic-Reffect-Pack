# Relic-Reffect-Pack
A more visible UI element for Relics with unique buffs.

Displays icons for unique relic buffs, as well as stacks and durations whenever they apply. By default this only will only be visible in combat.

(The relic name is due to the element being selected for editing, it will not appear in gameplay)

High-frequency buff relics, like Thief, Herald or Monk, will display a simplified UI, as they should, for the most part, always be at maximum stacks.

# Available Relics

Any of the following relics will be tracked automatically. Greyed out relics are Special Cases.

# Special Cases

Some relics will have active effects depending on other buffs instead of having their own unique buff. For these cases, these relics cannot be tracked directly, so they track their associated buff instead. Because of this, if enabled, they would be visible despite not having that relic equipped, as their visibility conditions trigger. Because of these, this list of relics will have to be enabled manually by the user when equiping said relic:

- Relic of Fire (Tracks active Fire Auras)
- Relic of Mistburn (Tracks Might over 10 stacks)
- Relic of the First Revenant (Tracks Resistance)
- Relic of Zakiros (Tracks Fury)

# Untrackable Relics

Any relics not included in this pack interact in ways that cannot be tracked, due to either having invisible cooldowns, being proc-based, or any other restriction that reffect cannot circumvent.

# How to use
First, download the zip file to your reffect root folder like so:

<img width="529" height="198" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f971542-31e3-4f72-88d8-72b6620daa28" />

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

Finally, enable / disable whichever interface size you prefer. If using any of the Special Case relics, enable / disable them here too:

If you want to have them always visible, select the pack, and then Filters > Combat > Always.

# Updates

This version includes a revision of all relics as of Vision's of Eternity's initial launch. Any relics added in future patches will be added to the pack as well, although re-downloading might reset its default values.
